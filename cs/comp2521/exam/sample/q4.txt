Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Cannot be Dijkstra's algorithm since it is not an MST algorithm, it is used to find shortest single source path.
Cannot be DFS since its not an MST algorithm.

Cannot be Prim's algorithm. After adding edge A - E, prim's algorithm would pick the next cheapest edge from E.
However, it picks an edge from a completely unrelated vertex instead, implying that it is picking edges based on their weight
priority and the edges already inserted do not matter. 

Therefore it is Kruskal's algorithm.
