Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.


Ordered array and linked list is less efficient for insertion and deletion since it has time complexity of O(n).
Hash Table has is less efficient due to insertion of O(n) at worst, because of resizing. Also it will not store 
elements in a sorted order.

AVL tree has the same time complexities as Heap, and it can also store items by priority however it allows for empty spaces
and has to be rebalanced frequently. 
Heap would be the most suitable. It has insertion and deletion of O(log n), and using a binary heap will print
the elements in order of priority in O(n) time. It also uses memory efficiently due to complete heap property.
