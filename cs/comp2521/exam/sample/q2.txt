Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

An ADT implies that the user cannot know of the implementation and is only allowed to use the interface functions provided.
In this case, the user tries to access the implementation file's struct graph, which returns an error 
of "incomplete struct graph", since that data structure is only meant to be for the implementation file and is not defined in the
interface file. Basically, this issue is because the user tried to access the implementation of the ADT which is forbidden.
