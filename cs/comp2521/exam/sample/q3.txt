Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

Option B.

A pre order traversal processes in order of: node, node->left, node->right. Because of the BST property that left child
is less than parent and right child is bigger than parent we notice that 2 is the left most value of the subtree and 
is left child of 7. We also see that 8 is the right child of 7. Now we consider that:

A post order traversal processes in order of: node->left, node->right, node. So our first 3 nodes must be 2, 8, 7. This 
eliminates all options except B since they have 2,7,8 instead of 2,8,7.

(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c) Give the rotations that are performed (if any) as a result of
    inserting each value.
After inserting 25: Rotate Right at 22
After inserting 8: idk
