Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the steps you would take to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.

Both Sorting algorithms are not stable so we cannot use stability property to distinguish them. However, Selection sort
always has time complexity of O(n^2) regardless of input and median three quicksort has complexity of O(nlogn). We can
time the algorithms with different input sizes to see how the time increases with respect to input sizes. If it has a 
"relatively" linear increase in time, it will have time complextiy of O(nlogn), i.e. median three quicksort, else if it has
rapid increase in time as input size increases, it will be selection sort. It is important to note that each input size 
should be timed multiple times to ensure relaibility.


(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.

Stability refers to the relative positioning of key value pairs that are the same value. If an algorithm is stable it will 
maintain the same key-value order. In this case, the algorithm IS STABLE because it maintains the order of key-value pairs 
that are the same. We can see that through the following, which shows position of key value pairs of same value.

Before Sorting:
(2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7)
(4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 4)
(5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9)

After Sorting:
(2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7)
(4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 4)
(5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9)

The positions of key-value pairs with same values are all maintained.
