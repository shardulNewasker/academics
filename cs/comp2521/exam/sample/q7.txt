Question 7

(a) How many items are examined in searching for the key 42? Justify
    your answer.
42 will be stored at index 9. We need to know how many items will exist in index 9. We need to find all elements upto 42 
such that x % 11 == 9. We have: 
11*0 + 9 = .., 
11*1 + 9 = .., 
11*2 + 9 = .., 
and finally 11*3 + 9 = 42. So there will be 4 items searched.


(b) How many items are examined in searching for the key 111? Justify
    your answer.
111 will be stored in index 1. Using similar logic from (a), there will be 9 elements stored at index 1 (since it will go upto 11*9 + 1).
Note that 111 itself won't be stored since only numbers 1 to 100 were inserted. Therefore 9 items will be examined.


(c) What is the worst-case search cost after N total items have been
    inserted? Justify your answer.

From (b) we observe that for every 100 items inserted we will search through 9 items worst case. So worst case
after N total items = ceil(N/100) * 9.
