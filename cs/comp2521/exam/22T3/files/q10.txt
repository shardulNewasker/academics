Question 10

Which of the listed data structures is most suitable? Justify your
answer. You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

Ordered array has Push and Pop of time O(n) which is inefficent. Deleting in range
will also be O(n) since after deletion, you have to rearrange the ordered array.

Ordered list will have Push and Pop of time O(n) which is inefficient, and removing in range will also be O(n)
since you have to travel through the nodes to get to the starting node.

Heap has Push and Pop of O(log n), since it has a BST structure as a min heap which is more efficinet than previous optoins.
Removing in range will be O(R log n) where R is the range. This is because after each deletion, in worst case, the heap will be
restructured by pushing a value to the height of the tree. 

Hash table is the most suitable because it has insertion of O(1) (except for resizing which is O(n)). It can Pop in O(n)
time and it can remove in range in O(R) time where R is the range.
